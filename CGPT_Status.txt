Since I don’t retain memory across sessions, the safest way to resume later is to give me a short Project Status Summary at the start of the next session.

Project Status:
- Current milestone: Day 2 complete – Flask app running, factory + blueprint working
- App tested locally: yes
- GitHub pushed: yes
- Next planned milestone: Day 3 – Prepare for Azure deployment, environment variables in App Service
- Any errors/issues: none
